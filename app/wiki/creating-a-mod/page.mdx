# Creating a Project

<Box>

In the Kristal project list, there's a button at the bottom which says "Create a new project".

<>![](/wiki/create_new_project.png)</>

In here, you can configure things like the name of your project,
the description, what chapter of DELTARUNE it's based on,
and you can configure each feature changed between chapters.

You can view the full list of configurable features [here](/wiki/configurable-features).
</Box>

## Installing Visual Studio Code
---

Visual Studio Code is the recommended code editor for Kristal projects. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

(Please ignore all of the AI stuff on the website... you can easily turn it off.
We've been using Visual Studio Code from before that happened...)

Once VSCode is installed, install the official Kristal extension [from here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kristal.kristal-vscode).
It will make your life much easier.

That's it, you're now ready!
</Box>

## Opening your project in Visual Studio Code
---

With your project folder open, either right click inside of it, or right click the folder itself, and click "**Open with Code**".
In the screenshot below, I'm using Visual Studio Code Insiders, but it's the same no matter what version you use.

<>![](/wiki/open_with_code.png)</>

Make sure to click "**Yes, I trust the authors**" when prompted -- you're the author, because this is your project!

<>![](/wiki/trust_authors.png)</>

</Box>

<Box>
## Using Visual Studio Code
---

The left-hand side of the screen has the **file explorer**. These are the files in your project!
You can click on them once to preview them, or double click to open them.

(A preview tab has an *italics* name, and will get replaced by other files you try to open.
Most of the time, if you want to edit a file, you should open it normally instead of previewing it.)

</Box>

<Box>
## Project Structure
---

Now you can see your project files, let's talk folders! It's important to have an idea what folders contain which files.

---


### The Root Folder

The "root" folder refers to the topmost folder of your project,
the one that contains everything else! It's the same one you just opened with Visual Studio Code.

You might hear it referred to as "the root of your project",
or just "your project folder" as you've seen here.

<details> 

<summary>
*Key Content (Click to expand)*
</summary>

Two key files are stored in the root folder: `mod.lua` and `mod.json`. 

On top of that, all of your project content folders are stored here:

- assets
- scripts
- libraries
- preview

*These are covered in detail later in this section.*

Back to these `mod` files - what are they?

(In the past, Kristal projects were called "mods", but too much confusion was caused by the name.
To make sure old projects are still compatible, we kept the name of these files the same.)

Well, `mod.lua` is where you can modfiy your `Mod` object.
The `Mod` object can define code to be run for a variety of engine-determined event calls.

(The wiki doesn't have a list of event calls... but the `KRISTAL_EVENT` enum in the source code does!
Here's a [quick link](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/blob/main/src/engine/vars.lua#L179) if you can't find it.)

The other file, `mod.json`, is your project's configuration file.
Here you can change the chapter configs you selected during project creation, and some other behaviour, like the **initial save state** of your project.

Many keys in `mod.json` **only apply to new save files**, so make sure to create fresh saves when testing changes to it!

### The Assets Folder

The assets folder stores, well, assets. It's where sprites, sounds, fonts, music and speech bubbles get stored, to be loaded by the engine.

<details>

<summary>
*Assets sub-folders (Click to expand)*
</summary>

Each type of asset is stored in it's own sub-folder.

<details>

<summary>
#### Sprites - `assets/sprites`
</summary>

Stores all the textures/images for your project. Accepted file types are `.png` or `.jpg`.

For animated sprites, each frame should be saved as a seperate image, with the frame number being attached to the end of the name (e.g. `idle_1.png`, `idle_2.png`, ...). **Kristal does not support `.gif` files or spritesheets for animations**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Sounds - `assets/sounds`
</summary>

Stores all the sound files for your project. Accepted file tyes are `.wav` and `.ogg`.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Music - `assets/music`
</summary>

Stores all the music files for your project. Accepted file types are `.wav`, `.ogg`, and `.mp4` (`.ogg` is recommended).

You can modify the global in-game volume and pitch of any track in `mod.lua` with the `MUSIC_VOLUMES` and `MUSIC_PITCHES` tables:
```lua
function Mod:init()
    -- Example: How you would make WELCOME TO THE CITY (`cybercity.ogg`) detuned the same way it is in DELTARUNE
    MUSIC_VOLUMES["cybercity"] = 0.8
    MUSIC_PITCHES["cybercity"] = 0.97
end
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Fonts - `assets/fonts`
</summary>

Stores all the custom fonts (and any supporting information about them) for your project. Accepted fonts are `.ttf`, `.fnt`, or `.png`.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Speech Bubbles - `assets/bubbles`
</summary>

Stores speech bubble data in `.json` files. The actual sprites used to construct bubbles are stored in `assets/sprites/bubbles`. Sorry to burst your bubble...

(You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/tree/main/assets/bubbles) to see how the default bubbles are constructed.)

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Shaders - `assets/shaders`
</summary>

Stores shadercode for your project. All shaders are `.glsl` files.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Videos - `assets/videos`
</summary>

Stores video files for your project. They must be encoded in the Ogg theora format (`.ogv`, `.ogg`) to play correctly.

</details>

</details>

#### Asset Paths

When referencing any type of Asset in your project, the code will eventually call into `Assets` - you might even be doing so directly!

The file paths you use for assets should begin **inside the type's sub-folder** and **exclude the file extension**.

For example, a sprite stored at `assets/sprites/world/events/sign.png` is just `world/events/sign` whenever you need to reference it in your code.

Note that some functions and features of the engine may look for assets from more specific locations. For example, `Game:setBorder()` searches starting from `assets/sprites/borders`.

#### Replacing Engine Assets

Assets used directly by the engine aren't visible inside your project folder, but they're still loaded and accessed in the same way.

You can view the engine's assets from the `assets` folder of the [source code](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/tree/main). If you want to **replace** these assets (e.g. to reskin the UI) you can do so by placing your replacement texture at the **same file path in your project's assets**!

### The Scripts Folder

Scripts are the code of your project. This folder contains all of them, whether it's cutscenes, enemies, or even data, like items.

All scripts are `.lua` files, and each type of script must be inside a specific folder to be loaded.

<details>

<summary>
*Scripts sub-folders (Click to expand)*
</summary>

Your project will include empty folders for most types of script by default. Let's briefly introduce them all.

<details>

<summary>
#### Battle - `scripts/battle`
</summary>

This folder contains everything associated with battles in Kristal. There are several sub-folders of battle for each script type:

- `bullets` - for `Bullet` scripts.
- `cutscenes` - for `BattleCutscene`s or groups of `BattleCutscene`.
- `encounters` - for `Encounter` scripts.
- `enemies` - for `EnemyBattler` scripts.
- `waves` - for `Wave` scripts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Borders - `scripts/borders`
</summary>

The scripts in this folder define custom `Border` objects that support animations.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Data - `scripts/data`
</summary>

This folder contains the scripts of everything data-based, like items. There are several sub-folders for each data type:

- `actors` - Scripts that define the data of your project's characters.
- `items` - Scripts for all your project's items.
- `party` - Scripts for your project's custom party members.
- `recruits` - Scripts for all your enemies RECRUIT data.
- `spells` - Scripts for your project's spells.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Hooks - `scripts/hooks`
</summary>

This folder contains hook scripts - they're an advanced engine tool for modfiying engine code.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Legends - `scripts/legends`
</summary>

This folder contains `LegendCutscene` scripts for... legend-styled cutscenes!

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### Objects - `scripts/objects`
</summary>

This folder contains custom object types for your project. You might use this folder for things like advanced spell effects and custom souls, as well as many other things.

Each object in this folder is placed into a global variable **matching it's ID**. You can create instances of your new object through this global; If your object is `MyNewObject`, creating an instance would look like this:

```lua
-- This line creates a new instance of MyNewObject
local object = MyNewObject()

-- We also need to parent our object to something else after we've created it.
Game.stage:addChild(object)
```

You can learn about how script IDs are determined [below](#script-ids).

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#### World - `scripts/world`
</summary>

This folder contains everything associated with maps and the world in Kristal. There are several sub-folders of world for each script type:

- `bullets` - for `WorldBullet` scripts.
- `cutscenes` - for `WorldCutscene`s of groups of `WorldCutscene`.
- `events` - for `Event`s - the type of objects that appear in maps.
- `maps` - for map files.
- `scripts` - for generic script types - these are mainly used with the `script` and `interactable` events.
- `tilesets` - for all your tileset scripts.

</details>

#### Script IDs

Scripts load into a part of Kristal known as the `Registry`. When that happens, they are assigned an ID you'll need to know to access them later.

The ID assigned to a script is determined in two simple steps - it's very important to know them!

**Step 1.** The engine checks whether the script ID was defined explicitly as the second argument to `Class()` (in most scripts). If it is, that's the script's ID.

**Step 2.** If the script doesn't have an explicit ID, the engine uses it's file path. This starts from the **subfolder of the script type**, not the `scripts` folder.
For example, an item at `scripts/data/items/light/pencil.lua` would be assigned the ID `light/pencil`.

These are also **case-sensitive** - `Light/Pencil` and `light/pencil` are considered completely seperate IDs!

#### Changing Engine Scripts

The engine has some `data/` scripts that appear ingame but are not visible from your project folder. If you want to modify them, you'll need to use hooks.

Hooks are a more advanced feature of the engine that aren't recommended if you're starting out. But when you need them, you can read about them [here](/wiki/hooks).

### The Libraries Folder

Libraries are externally sourced code and assets - the [Libraries page](/wiki/using-libraries) will tell you more about them.

---

### The Preview Folder

The preview folder stores everything related to how your project appears on the Kristal menu.

... Huh? There's no preview guide on the wiki? Quickly, cut to the end of the article!
