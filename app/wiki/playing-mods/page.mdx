# Installing and Playing Projects

<Box>

When you open Kristal, the main menu has an option to open the projects folder. This is where you can place the fangames you have downloaded.

<>![](/wiki/open_folder.png)</>

Note that, if packaged correctly, you do not have to unzip the fangame. You can just place the zip file in the projects folder.

</Box>

<Box>
## "The fangame doesn't show up in the list!" [doesnt-show-up]

If a fangame doesn't show up in the list, it may have been packaged incorrectly. If it's a ZIP archive, make sure it's not nested in a folder.

**You cannot play libraries as fangames.** Libraries are *for use* in fangames, and cannot be played alone.
</Box>

<Box>
## "The option doesn't work/crashes Kristal!" [manual-paths]

The cause of this bug is unknown, and most likely is out of our control. In this case, you'll have to navigate to the fangames folder manually.
