# Creating an Item

<Box>

Has this ever happened to you? You're making a shop, but then you realize you don't have any items to sell! Happens all the time, right? What do you mean there isn't a shop tutorial yet...?

Creating items mostly involves copy pasting, then changing a few values. It's not too hard, but it can be a bit tedious if you're making a large amount of them.

## Basic Items
---

Let's say you want to make an item that does, well, nothing but take up inventory space. Just make a new Lua file in `data/items`.

Here's an example item. It's useless, but it's an item.

```lua
local item, super = Class(Item, "useless_item")

function item:init()
    super.init(self)

    -- Display name
    self.name = "Useless Item"
    -- Name displayed when used in battle (optional)
    self.use_name = nil

    -- Item type (item, key, weapon, armor)
    self.type = "item"
    -- Item icon (for equipment)
    self.icon = nil
    -- Whether this item is for the light world
    self.light = false

    -- Battle description
    self.effect = "Useless"
    -- Shop description
    self.shop = "Useless"
    -- Menu description
    self.description = "This item is useless"
    -- Light world check text
    self.check = "It's useless"

    -- Default shop price (sell price is halved)
    self.price = 0
    -- Whether the item can be sold
    self.can_sell = false

    -- Consumable target mode (ally, party, enemy, enemies, or none)
    self.target = "none"
    -- Where this item can be used (world, battle, all, or none)
    self.usable_in = "none"
end

return item
```

See, it's just changing a bunch of variables. But, what if we want it to *do* something? That's where `self.target` and `self.usable_in` come in.

---

### `self.target`

`self.target` determines who the item can be used on. It can be one of the following:
- `ally`: you pick an ally to use the item on
- `party`: you use it on the entire party
- `enemy`: you pick an enemy to use the item on
- `enemies`: you use it on all enemies
- `none`: there's no target, you just use it

---

### `self.usable_in`

`self.usable_in` determines where the item can be used. It can be one of the following:
- `world`: you can use it in the overworld
- `battle`: you can use it in battle
- `all`: you can use it anywhere
- `none`: you can't use it

---

### Making it do something

Let's make it usable in the overworld. That's easy, just change `self.usable_in` to `"world"`. We should also make you select an ally to use it on, so change `self.target` to `"ally"`.

```lua
function item:onWorldUse(target)
    return false
end
```

This is the function that gets called when you use the item in the overworld. It takes one argument, `target`, which is the target you selected.

So uh, let's make it explode people. This is why I wanted the player to select a target.

```lua
function item:onWorldUse(target)
    local character = Game.world:getPartyCharacter(target)
    if character then
        character:explode()
    end
    return false
end
```

If you give yourself the item, then try to use it on someone, they explode! Perfect, right?

Oh, right - how *do* we give ourselves the item?

### Giving items

There's a few different ways to give yourself items, like shops and chests! But most of the time you want to use the function `Game.inventory:tryGiveItem(item)` to give items from absolutely wherever you want.

This is an awesome function that, as it's name suggests, tries to give us an item, and handles not being able to. Just in case the player is hoarding 48 rotten teas already.

So, to give out this awesome item, we could run something like this from another piece of code, like a cutscene: 

```lua
local success, result_text = Game.inventory:tryGiveItem("useless_item") -- This gives out our item to the player

cutscene:text(result_text) -- This displays the "You got the ..." and "ITEM was added to your STORAGE" texts or "You already have too many ITEMs" which are generated by us from tryGiveItem.
```

But wait! This isn't a cutscene tutorial... Surely there's an easier way to test out our item?

You're in luck! Because there's also a ***Debug Menu*** in Kristal. And it can give us items too.

Just press `` Shift + ` `` (On some keyboards it may be `` Shift + ~ `` instead). A KRISTAL DEBUG menu should then appear.

Look around the menu for the `Give Item` option - that's what we're looking for. Then search for `useless_item` and select it. You'll hear a noise, and the item should now be in your inventory!

## Heal Items
---

Heal items are simple, just extend `HealItem` instead.

You'll want to set `self.heal_amount` to the amount you want the item to heal the user. And... that's the only difference. Neat.
</Box>

## Armor
---

Here's everything special in the white ribbon:

```lua
self.type = "armor"
self.icon = "ui/menu/icon/armor"
-- Equip bonuses (for weapons and armor)
self.bonuses = {
    defense = 2
}
-- Bonus name and icon (displayed in equip menu)
self.bonus_name = "Cuteness"
self.bonus_icon = "ui/menu/icon/up"

-- Equippable characters (default true for armors, false for weapons)
self.can_equip = {
    susie = false
}
```

Bonuses is a simple table, taking `defense`, `magic` and `attack`, all optional keys.

## Weapons
---

Here's some code from the EverybodyWeapon, an unused weapon:

```lua
self.type = "weapon"
self.icon = nil

-- Equip bonuses (for weapons and armor)
self.bonuses = {
    attack  = 12,
    defense = 6,
    magic   = 8,
}

-- No special bonus
self.bonus_name = nil
self.bonus_icon = nil

-- Everyone can equip
self.can_equip = {}
```

</Box>

<Box>
## Key Items
---

Code from the cell phone:
```lua
self.type = "key"
```

...Yep, that's all you need to do.

</Box>

<Box>
## Reactions
---

When you use an item, or equip one, characters might react. This is done with the `self.reactions` table. Taking a look at the EverybodyWeapon again, we get:

```lua
-- Character reactions
self.reactions = {
    susie = "Uhhh... Ok.",
    ralsei = "A perfect fit!",
    noelle = "Wh... what is this?",
}
```
</Box>
