### Function Hooking (with `Utils.hook()`)

A function hook changes just one function at a time using the `Utils.hook()` function.

When using `Utils.hook()`, we should always be inside `Mod:init()`, which is inside the `mod.lua` file.

The full signature of the function is `Utils.hook(target, name, hook)`. `target` is the name of the target class, `name` is the function we want to replace, and `hook` is our new function.

`hook` is a function receiving `orig` (the **original function**), `self`, and then all of the hooked function's arguments.

Let's put that down as some template code we can read. If we were to insert a hook into an otherwise empty `mod.lua`, it would look something like this:

```lua
function Mod:init()
    print("Loaded "..self.info.name.."!")

    -- This would hook over "MyClass:myFunction(...)", replacing it's code with our own.
    Utils.hook(MyClass, "myFunction", function (orig, self, ...)
        orig(self, ...) -- Call the original "MyClass:myFunction(...)"
    end)
end
```
*(This code is only an example of hook structure, `MyClass` does not exist, and attempting to use this will cause a crash.)*

That's all it takes to hook a function! Our hook wouldn't be very interesting though, as all it's doing is calling the original function...

So... let's test hooking on a real Kristal function! 

Our target for this example will be the `EnemyBattler:hurt()` function.

Let's swap in some names to our above template to hook EnemyBattler:

```lua
Utils.hook(EnemyBattler, "hurt", function (orig, self, ...)
    orig(self, ...)
end)
```

Having our function arguments as `...` here isn't great. They'll pass into the original function fine, but we can't really use them ourselves.

This is where having the **source code** is important. Let's look for `EnemyBattler:hurt` inside `enemybattler.lua`!

In VSCode, opening the **source code folder** and searching `enemybattler` in the top searchbar will lead you to the file. Similarly GitHub has the `go to file` searchbox. (Other editors will likely have similar search features)

Then, use `Ctrl+F` to search up `EnemyBattler:hurt`. You should be taken straight to the function!

What we want to do is swap `...` for the arguments listed there.

If you've done it correctly, the hook should now look like this:

```lua
Utils.hook(EnemyBattler, "hurt", function (orig, self, amount, battler, on_defeat, color, show_status, attacked)
    orig(self, amount, battler, on_defeat, color, show_status, attacked)
end)
```

Now we can make a few changes - let's log some information to the Kristal console before and after the EnemyBattler is hurt.

```lua
Utils.hook(EnemyBattler, "hurt", function (orig, self, amount, battler, on_defeat, color, show_status, attacked)
    -- Code above the original function runs before it:
    Kristal.Console:log("Enemy " .. self.name .. " has " .. self.health .. " HP.")

    Kristal.Console:log("Hurting enemy for " .. amount .. " damage")
    -- Original EnemyBattler:hurt runs
    orig(self, amount, battler, on_defeat, color, show_status, attacked) 

    -- Code below the original function runs after it:
    Kristal.Console:log("Enemy " .. self.name .. " has " .. self.health .. " HP.")

    Kristal.Console:log("-------------")
end)
```

Aside from the differences we mentioned before, you can see that everything we write is as if we were in `EnemyBattler:hurt` itself!

If we test this out ingame by attacking an enemy a few times, we should see this code printing to the console every time `EnemyBattler:hurt` runs: 

![image](/wiki/hook_console_output.png)

(You can press ` to make the Kristal console appear.)

With this, we can make any code we want run just before or after any EnemyBattler gets hurt - including changing what gets passed into the function (increasing the damage amount, for example).

Feel free to experiment with this hook a bit to get a taste of what they can do!

---

If you want to change something that happens **within** `EnemyBattler:hurt`, things are a bit different.

Hooks can't partially modify the code of an existing function, so the only way to do this is to **remove the original function call** and copy the source code of `EnemyBattler:hurt` into your hook. 

From there, you can safely modify it however you like.

## Hook Annotations

The Lua language server can't properly understand changes to functions made through `Utils.hook()`, even with annotations.

For hook annotations and language server support, you must use the recommended [`Utils.hookScript()`](/wiki/hooks) method of hooking.
