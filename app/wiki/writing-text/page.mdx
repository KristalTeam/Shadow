# Writing Text

<Box>

(Note: this page is a work-in-progress. It is public for the sake of having at least some documentation on text writing.)

You'd think that writing text is just writing text, but in Kristal (and DELTARUNE), there are a few things to keep in mind.

</Box>

<Box>
## Kristal's Text System [text-system]

Kristal's text system is pretty simple. You can just write text, and the system will try to do what it can to make it look good.

```lua
local text = "* This is text!"
```

---

### Line Breaks [line-breaks]

If you want a line break, you can either let the engine wrap it automatically, or you can force a line break using `\n`.

```lua
local text = "* This is a really long line of text that will probably wrap around on its own."
```

```lua
local text = "* This one is long too,\nbut we wrapped it manually!"
```

Line breaks are "indented" to work with DELTARUNE's prefix system. That means the above line will show as:

```none
* This one is long too,
  but we wrapped it manually!
```

which may not be what you want if you want the next line to also use the asterisk prefix.

Kristal's text system does work with this, however, and will unindent the line if it starts with the prefix:

```lua
local text = "* This is one line...\n* And this is another,\nwhich is cool."
```

```none
* This is one line...
* And this is another,
  which is cool.
```

</Box>

## Text Modifiers [text-modifiers]

Text modifiers are pieces of text which change how the text is displayed, rather than being part of the text itself.

Meaning, the following text will turn the word "yellow" into yellow text:

```lua
local text = "* This is [color:yellow]yellow[color:reset] text!"
```

Note that not all modifiers are available in all contexts. In any "instant" text which supports modifiers, `wait` is not available, for example.

---

### Available Modifiers [available-modifiers]

This is a list of all available text modifiers in Kristal.

#### Base Modifiers (usable anywhere) [base-modifiers]

- <Anchor link="color-modifier">`[color:<color>]`</Anchor> - Changes the color of the text. Available colors are:
    - `red` - <span style={{color: "#FF0000"}}>Red</span>
    - `blue` - <span style={{color: "#0000FF"}}>Blue</span>
    - `yellow` - <span style={{color: "#FFFF00"}}>Yellow</span>
    - `green` - <span style={{color: "#00FF00"}}>Green</span>
    - `white` - <span style={{color: "#FFFFFF"}}>White</span>
    - `black` - <span style={{color: "#FFFFFF"}}>Black</span> (preview is white for readability)
    - `purple` - <span style={{color: "#7F007F"}}>Purple</span>
    - `maroon` - <span style={{color: "#7F0000"}}>Maroon</span>
    - `pink` - <span style={{color: "#FF7FFF"}}>Pink</span>
    - `lime` - <span style={{color: "#7FFF7F"}}>Lime</span>
    - `<hex code>` - Any hex color code, like `#FF5733`.
    - `reset` - Resets the color to the default text color.

    Note that this list of colors is based on what DELTARUNE's writer used, therefore it is separate from the global COLORS table.
- <Anchor link="font-modifier">`[font:<font>,<size>]`</Anchor> - Changes the font of the text. Can be any font loaded. `reset` resets to the default font. `size` is optional.
- <Anchor link="style-modifier">`[style:<style>]`</Anchor> - Changes the style of the text. Default styles are:
    - `none` - Normal text, without any effects.
    - `dark` - The dark world's text style, which uses a drop shadow gradient, and colored text is also turned into gradients.
    - `dark_menu` - Normal text, with a gray dropshadow.
    - `GONER` - The "glowing" text used in the intro of DELTARUNE Chapter 1, some places in game overs, and at the end of Chapters 3 & 4.
    - `reset` - Resets to the default text style.
- <Anchor link="shake-modifier">`[shake:<intensity>]`</Anchor> - Makes the text shake. Intensity is optional, and defaults to 1. Higher numbers make it shake "further". `[shake:0]` to disable.
- <Anchor link="wave-modifier">`[wave:<distance>,<offset>,<speed>]`</Anchor> - Makes each character move in a "wave" pattern, like from Undertale. All arguments are optional. `[wave:0]` to disable.
- <Anchor link="image-modifier">`[image:<image>,<x_offset>,<y_offset>,<x_scale>,<y_scale>,<anim_speed>]`</Anchor> - Inserts an image into the text. All arguments except for the first are optional.

    Note: in DialogueText, this will play the voice sound.
- <Anchor link="bind-modifier">`[bind:<action>]`</Anchor> - Inserts a "bind" for the given keybind. This will either be a button icon (if using a gamepad), or the primary bind key's in brackets (if using keyboard).

    Example: `"Press [bind:confirm]!"` will either show "Press [Z]!" or "Press <img src="/wiki/switch_btn_a.png" alt="A" style={{verticalAlign: "middle"}}/>!" depending on the input method.
- <Anchor link="button-modifier">`[button:<button>]`</Anchor> - Inserts a gamepad button's icon in text. You should not need this in most cases. Used internally by `[bind]`, which you probably want instead.

    Note: in DialogueText, this will play the voice sound.
- <Anchor link="offset-modifier">`[offset:<x>,<y>]`</Anchor> - Offsets the text by a certain amount of pixels. To undo, enter the negative of the values you used, as it's additive.
- <Anchor link="indent-modifier">`[indent:<string>]`</Anchor> - Changes the "indent string" to the specified string.
- <Anchor link="spacing-modifier">`[spacing:<number>]`</Anchor> - Changes the spacing between characters. Default is 0.

#### Dialogue Modifiers (usable in DialogueText) [dialogue-modifiers]

- <Anchor link="wait-modifier">`[wait:<frames>]`</Anchor> - Waits for a certain number of frames before continuing. 30 frames is 1 second.

    Normally, all punctuation is followed by a 5 frame wait, so please insert those when appropriate. See [Punctuation](#punctuation) for more info.

    To wait in seconds, append `s` to the number, like `[wait:1s]` to wait 1 second.
- <Anchor link="voice-modifier">`[voice:<voice>]`</Anchor> - Sets the text sound ("voice") of the current text, relative to the `voice` folder.

    `reset` resets it to the default, and `none` disables the sound.
- <Anchor link="noskip-modifier">`[noskip:<bool>]`</Anchor> - `bool` is optional, most of the time you just write `[noskip]`.

    If `bool` is falsy, the text can be skipped as normal, useful to re-enable skipping after disabling it.
- <Anchor link="func-modifier">`[func:<name>,<arg1>,<arg2>,...]`</Anchor> - Calls a defined function for this text.

    This should never be used to modify state, as this does NOT run during auto-wrap calculations or width/height calculations.

    When the function with argument `name` is called, it'll pass in the rest of the arguments as strings.
- <Anchor link="talk-modifier">`[talk:<bool>]`</Anchor> - With this, you can disable the "talking" animation of the current NPC, if applicable.
- <Anchor link="sound-modifier">`[sound:<sound>]`</Anchor> - Plays a sound effect.
- <Anchor link="next-modifier">`[next]`</Anchor> - Immediately marks the text as advanceable (not waiting for input), even if it isn't finished yet.
- <Anchor link="instant-modifier">`[instant]`</Anchor> - Makes the text appear instantly, rather than being "typed out".
- <Anchor link="stopinstant-modifier">`[stopinstant]`</Anchor> - Stops the instant text effect, and resumes normal text.
- <Anchor link="speed-modifier">`[speed:<speed>]`</Anchor> - Changes the speed of the text, using a multiplier. Default is `1`, `0.5` is half speed, `0` never advances, `2` is double speed, etc.

#### Textbox Modifiers (usable in textboxes) [overworld-modifiers]

Textboxes only appear in the overworld and in battles. They're normally accompanied by a character portrait.

- <Anchor link="face-modifier">`[face:<face>,<offset_x>,<offset_y>]`</Anchor> - Changes the current portrait to the specified one. `offset_x` and `offset_y` are optional.

    Uses the current speaker.
- <Anchor link="facec-modifier">`[facec:<face>,<offset_x>,<offset_y>]`</Anchor> - A "custom" variant, used to change the portrait to any portrait, rather than one of the speaker's portraits.

    Can be useful in niche scenarios, but you shouldn't need this very often.
- <Anchor link="react-modifier">`[react:<reaction>]` OR `[react:<text>,<x>,<y>,<face>,<actor>]`</Anchor> - Shows a "reaction", which is the smaller text which slides in.

    The first variant is an index to the reaction table, which should hold all of the necessary information.

    The second variant has all of the information in-line.
- <Anchor link="miniface-modifier">`[miniface:<face>,<offset_x>,<offset_y>,<x_scale>,<y_scale>,<anim_speed>]`</Anchor> - Displays a miniface, which is a replacement for the asterisk.

#### Speech Bubble Modifiers (usable in speech bubbles) [speech-bubble-modifiers]

Speech bubbles are when battlers talk.

- <Anchor link="noautoskip-modifier">`[noautoskip]`</Anchor> - This modifier prevents the bubble from being automatically advanced after 3 seconds.

#### Shop Modifiers (usable in shops) [shop-modifiers]

- <Anchor link="emote-modifier">`[emote:<emotion>]`</Anchor> - Calls `Shop:onEmote(emotion)`, which can be used to change the shopkeeper's expression.

## Following Standards [following-standards]

DELTARUNE's text has a few standards to follow. While you don't HAVE to follow them, it can feel out of place or weird if you don't.

---

### Punctuation [punctuation]

Generally, any punctuation is followed by a `[wait:5]`, as punctuation is a pause in speech.
You can wait for longer of course, but DELTARUNE rarely does this.

Example:
```lua
local text = {
    "* Hi...[wait:5] Kris,[wait:5] was it?",
    "* You...[wait:5] don't remember me?",
    "* I understand...[wait:5] I wouldn't remember me,[wait:5] either."
}
```

I sort of went overboard with the elipses, but you get the idea. Anything that would naturally cause a pause in speech should be a pause in text.

---

### Emphasis [emphasis]

Emphasis uses capital letters. Even Sans uses them in Undertale to emphasise certain things.

![Sans using capital letters, saying "it's ALWAYS funny."](/wiki/sans_capital_letters.png)

Sometimes, important things are **highlighted in yellow**, like what our website does. Don't overuse this!

Yellow is what's used most of the time,
but if a different color is needed (for lore reasons, a strong warning, or explaining a mechanic with a color), you can use other colors.
